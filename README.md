SOFTWARE ENGINEERING for Geoinformatics Engineering 
the project aims to  development of a web page for solid waste management requires graphic 
and spatial data based on the project requirements. To support and develop such a site, 
we must work on libraries that provide the necessary conditions and generate the best results,
as well as visualize the concept in the appropriate way.
The study area is in India. It is intended to develop a web page to display waste dumping sites
and the level of environmental damage that this type of behavior may cause. This type of presentation
may lead to a kind of awareness and draw the attention of organizations and government agencies that
may help support and provide solutions.
Around the world, waste generation rates are rising. In 2016, the worlds’ cities generated 
2.01 billion tons of solid waste, amounting to a footprint of 0.74 kilograms per person per 
day. With rapid population growth and urbanization, annual waste generation is expected 
to increase by 70% from 2016 levels to 3.40 billion tons in 2050.
Compared to those in developed nations, residents in developing countries, especially the 
urban poor, are more severely impacted by unsustainably managed waste. In low-income 
countries, over 90% of waste is often disposed of in unregulated dumps or openly burned. 
These practices create serious health, safety, and environmental consequences. Poorly 
managed waste serves as a breeding ground for disease vectors, contributes to global 
climate change through methane generation, and can even promote urban violence.
Managing waste properly is essential for building sustainable and livable cities, but it 
remains a challenge for many developing countries and cities. Effective waste 
management is expensive, often comprising 20%–50% of municipal budgets. Operating 
this essential municipal service requires integrated systems that are efficient, sustainable, 
and socially supported.
